# PyTorch Tutorial
1) **Linear Algebra, part one:** Using PyTorch for doing some calculations in the field of Linear Algebra; becoming familar with **Tensor** and how to use it to define vectors and matrices.  
2) **Doing math:** Plotting some math functions using PyTorch and Matplotlib. Also, doing some reduction oeprations such as mean and std.
3) **Tensors** in PyTorch, closer view: We usually create tensors with initialization or randomly. Then, we can use them similar to the way we use arrays in Numpy.
