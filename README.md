# PyTorch Tutorial
1) **Linear Algebra, part one:** Using PyTorch for doing some calculations in the field of Linear Algebra; becoming familar with **Tensor** and how to use it to define vectors and matrices.  
2) **Doing math:** Plotting some math functions using PyTorch and Matplotlib. Also, doing some reduction oeprations such as mean and std.
3) **Tensors** in PyTorch, closer view: We usually create tensors with initialization or randomly. Then, we can use them similar to the way we use arrays in Numpy.
4) **ToTensor():** Here, we become familiar with the transform ToTensor(). It changes images of Type PIL or numpy.ndarray. Some examples including *CIFAR10* are provided.
5) **Datasets in PyTorch:** How to use (x,y) pairs of the dataset samples in PyTorch using the Dataset class. One way is to use **TensorDataset**, and the second way is to define our own **custom Dataset**. For this purpose, we employ the **iris** dataset.
6) **DataLoaders in PyTorch:** When we have a Dataset, we can apply DataLoader to it, so that we can iterate over the dataset with ease. A DataLoader supports iter() and next() methods.
